# Project Descriptions
## Automata
Conway's game of life, in the terminal using ncurses.
## Bifurcation

## Chess
Partially finished chess engine. Can take PGM input, check for legal moves, and uses minimax with various optimizations.
* Null move pruning
* Opening book
* Bitboards
* Zobirst hashing
## Cryptography
Short program to test a distiguisher for a proposed psuedorandom number generator, showing that it can be distiguished with non-negligble frequency. Made for a cryptograhpy class I took.
## HACKER
Short ncurses program to render an ASCII skull with falling 1s and 0s to a terminal. Totally real hacking.
## Mandlebrot
### Mandlebrot1
Renders a mandlebrot set in ASCII to a terminal. Has various options, including the ability to automatically find interesting regions at various scales.
### FFractal2
Improved version of FFractal and the successor to Mandlebrot1. Renders to an image file, using mutliple threads for faster render times and some optimizations that significantly increase performance for nearly zero quality loss. Also has options for custom gradients.
Easily adapted to render other fractals as well, such as the burning ship fractal.
